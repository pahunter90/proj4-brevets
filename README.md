A reimplementation of the Brevet Time Calculator provided by the ACP. As opposed to the ACP's lackluster calculator interface this calculator is interactive to the user, providing start and stop times as the user types in distances. This calcultor will only work for ACP sanctioned distances. Look at the acp brevet website for more information on their requirements (...good luck).

Info for the User:
Choose your distance, start date and start time.
You can change any of those at any time and the form will re-calculate. It will also give errors for distances that are too long, or negative. When the form re-calculates the errors disappear if they are fixed. Km will automatically convert to miles and vice versa. Decimal values are acceptable, but the distance will be rounded to the nearest km for the open and close time calculations.

Warnings:
The calculator will allow you to make routes not within the ACP rules. Please check the ACP rules for information on what makes a route acceptable.
